# mandelbrotimg
A very simplistic mandelbrot image generator written in Python using Django

## How to install

1. You'll need Python 3.x to run this project (installing python depends on your environment)
2. I strongly recommend you install `pip` to manage python packages
3. I strongly recommend you install `virtualenv` and create/start a new virtual python environment
4. Install Django: `pip install Django`
5. CD into the project's working directory
6. Run all migrations: `./manage.py migrate`
7. Run the django server: `./manage.py runserver 8080`
8. Any problems, please email me at: mario[at]lionmane[dot]io
